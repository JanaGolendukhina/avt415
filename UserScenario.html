              <h2>Motivator</h2>
             
                <br>I am a Senior College student who loves making electronic music as a hobby, I draw inspiration from 50-70s Japanese and American Retro-Space sci-fi aesthetics.
				<p></p>
			 <h2>Intention</h2>
				<br>I would love to have music instruments such as guitar and that will fit into my style and vision.
			 <p></p>
				<h2>Action</h2>
				<br>I checked popular music-related web stores, and she couldn't find what she wanted because you cannot filter products by "style," so she searched "retro-space music instruments." since this is Rocketa's description, she found Rocketa's website quickly, and she has an extensive selection of products with the aesthetics she was looking for. She checks the "Instrument" section to find a "guitar" category, finds a model she likes, chooses an option and quantity, clicks add to cart, and then proceeds to checkout, filling in the needed shipping and payment information and then places an order.
				<p></p>
				<h2>Resolution</h2>
				<br> Now I have a new instrument that she can use to create music and film in her music videos to make them feel authentic with her overall aesthetic and style.
